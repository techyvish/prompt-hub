I'd like to learn about a {SUBJECT}. Remember, I want to master the {SUBJECT}. Please explain {SUBJECT} to me using compact, progressively challenging pieces of information, or "steps". My aim is to undertake an extensive, in-depth learning journey, comprising at least 1000 steps. Each step should be organized as follows:

**SECTION 1:** The first section introduces a new concept. Use analogy from daily life objects, events etc. Make topic easier to grasp and memorize. Prepare mnemonic wherever possible. Then introduce formal definition and related topics.  After the introduction, you should ask if I've understood the theory. If my response is negative, you must provide supplementary explanations until I confirm my understanding. However, if my response is positive, we move on to the second section. If I ask any unknown topic in the SECTION 1, then please give me extensive, in-depth explanation of the topic. Clearly show mathematical equations without any errors. Include related code examples whenever necessary. if you include code examples then explain code line by line.

**SECTION 2:** The second section of each step involves a question to evaluate my understanding of the newly introduced concept. The question must be related to topic covered in SECTION1. The question should be theory-based, something I can explain in words, answer with a simple 'yes' or 'no', or even respond to as part of a multiple-choice question. If I respond correctly, we transition to the third section. Do not ask questions that require mathematical equations solve without introducing the equation in SECTION 1. You can ask mathematical equations in this section after introducing it properly in SECTION 1. If I respond `explain me` then explain me answer in detail and then move on to next section. 

**SECTION 3:** Before you start SECTION 3, give the result of the previous question using word `right` or `wrong`. In both cases, explain the correct answer briefly. In the third section, you'll pose a more challenging question, often incorporating elements such as numbers, mathematics, or probability. This section is designed to test my comprehension in a way that may necessitate me jotting down numbers, mathematical equations, or sketches to formulate an answer. 

**SECTION 4:** Before you start SECTION 4, give the result of the previous question using word `right` or `wrong`. In both cases, explain the correct answer briefly. In the forth section, you'll summarize everything I've learned in the `SECTION 1`, `SECTION 2`, `SECTION 3`. Make it easy to memorize, and can be turned into flash cards. Create as many flashcards as you can. Name of flashcards should be Flashcard 1, Flashcard 2, and so on. Also include any important formula or equations discussed, calculations performed.

**Rules**

- These are the four sections that should be present in each of the 1000+ steps.

- Ensure to precede each response with the appropriate title for the current step/section. For instance, following this prompt, you should begin with the title: "Step 1: Section 1". Create appropriate title for `SECTION 1` of each steps. Make it bold. Title should be 5 to 8 words long. It should be easy to memorize and accurately describe the topic introduced in that `SECTION` 

- Suppose I fail to understand the new concept; you must respond with additional information, again with the title "Step 1: Section 1", until I indicate that I've understood. 

- If I ask a question about some topic that I did not understand then you should create a new section "Section 1: Step 1: Aside 1". If I have more questions on the same topic, name it "Section 1: Step 1: Aside 2". So, if I successfully understand this topic, then take me back to the "Section 1: Step 1"

- Afterward, proceed to "Step 1: Section 2", where you'll present a theoretical question to assess my understanding. If I answer incorrectly, inform me of my error while maintaining the title "Step 1: Section 2". I can make several attempts at your question, and you should only provide additional information to assist me if I request it.

- Once I answer correctly, proceed to "Step 1: Section 3", where you'll present a more complex question, which may involve numbers, mathematics, or sketches. If I've successfully solved challenging questions in "Step 1: Section 3" then you should ask me `do you want more questions?` if I say `yes` then you should ask me more questions otherwise move on to  "Step 1: Section 4"

- Then move on to "Step 1: Section 4" where you'll summarize the topic for me for easy recall. Please make flashcards to easy remember and recall. Once I answer `done`, progress to "Step 2: Section 1", where a new concept is introduced.

- make sure mark every section with step. example: `Step 1: Section 1`, `Step 1: Section 2`, `Step 1: Section 3`, `Step 2: Section 1`. Always keep track of Step, Section and Aside.Â
